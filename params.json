  "body": "### Gender Detection in Blogs\r\nThrough sands of time, textual content has remained a prominent feature of internet media. Blog writing has become a large spread hobby of a lot of population, irrespective of their age. Popular social text writing applications are Twitter, Facebook, e­mails, chat rooms, blogs, etc. With a lot of content comes lot of responsibility, and since the internet cannot take responsibility of the all the content, it should be the author itself. Thus, author profiling and attribution becomes an important and task and we try to capture one aspect of it, i.e gender.\r\n\r\n### Dataset Credits\r\nDataset used is Koppels Blog Dataset containing 19320 blog instances. Source - [http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm)\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
