  "body": "## Gender Detection in Blogs\r\nThrough sands of time, textual content has remained a prominent feature of internet media. Blog writing has become a large spread hobby of a lot of population, irrespective of their age. Popular social text writing applications are Twitter, Facebook, e­mails, chat rooms, blogs, etc. With a lot of content comes lot of responsibility, and since the internet cannot take responsibility of the all the content, it should be the author itself. Thus, author profiling and attribution becomes an important and task and we try to capture one aspect of it, i.e gender. This project thus aims on the profiling of blogs on the basis of gender of the author.\r\n\r\n## Dataset Credits\r\nDataset used is Koppels Blog Dataset containing 19320 blog instances. Source - [http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm)\r\n\r\n## Main System\r\nThe main system consists of:\r\n\r\n1. Feature Extraction from the blogs.\r\n2. Training the feature set on different classifier.\r\n3. Building up of an Ensemble model on the different classifiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Feature Extraction\r\nThe following set of features were used in the feature set for the task of classifying:\r\n\r\n* Character Based Features\r\n* Word Based Features\r\n* Syntactic Features\r\n* Structural Features\r\n* Function Words\r\n* POS Start Probability\r\n\r\n\r\n### Classification\r\nThe following set of classifiers are used for the task of classification:\r\n\r\n* Random Forest Classifier - Scikit Learn Python\r\n* Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks Classifier - Scikit Learn Python\r\n* Adaboost Tree Classifier - Scikit Learn Python\r\n* Gradient Boosting Classifier - Scikit Learn Python\r\n* Bagging Classifier - Scikit Learn Python\r\n\r\n### Predicting the output\r\n\r\nFor the prediction of output we have taken the Ensemble (ie the majority voting) from the Classifiers above.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\nFor now the tool works with an accuracy of around 73% for the Koppels Blog Dataset.\r\n\r\n## Future Improvements\r\n\r\n* Addition of more features to the feature set such as synonyms etc.\r\n* Usage of more advanced Classifiers in the Classification tasks such as Recurrent Neural Networks.\r\n* Extending the tool for multiple Languages.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nThis tool was made by Nitish Jain (@nitishjain2007), Ganesh Borle (@buggynap), and Vamshikrishna Reddy (@vamshi177) from International Institute of Information Technology as a part of Information Retrieval and Extraction course project. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
